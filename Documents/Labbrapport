Uppgift 1: 
Moved Sensitive data to appsettings.development.json, which will be ignored by the .gitignore, so it won't show
up on github anymore
Uppgift 2:
Added the need to test that a user can only get their own notes through swagger, and not anyone elses. 
Did this by vertifying that the identity of the user is the same as the identity of the one that created the note
