Uppgift 1: 
Moved Sensitive data to appsettings.development.json, which will be ignored by the .gitignore, so it won't show
up on github anymore
Uppgift 2:
Added the need to test that a user can only get their own notes through swagger, and not anyone elses. 
Did this by vertifying that the identity of the user is the same as the identity of the one that created the note
Uppgift 3:
Edited script.js in Notes.Client to write to a note as innerText instead of as innerHTML, which makes it much more
secure, because now even if what the user uploads to a note is a script tag, it will be converted to a string
Uppgift 4:
Edited NotesController.cs so that instead of returning SQL code directly it returns it in a LINQ format so that we
can take advantage of the security already buillt into that system
Uppgift 5:
Fixed the insecure deserialization issue in the program by changing it from working with typehandling.auto, into 
working with typehandling.none. This solves the security issues involved in .NET json.
Uppgift 6:
Updated so that we are not using the fake swashbuckler package. What I have learned here is to pay a lot of attention
to things like spelling mistakes, when you pick a package.

What I have learned:

I have learned about some security issues I need to think about when I make a program, what to look out for, and some
of the ways that I can prevent them.
